1. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
• Understanding the distribution of obesity percentages across states.
• Visualizing patterns and identifying high-risk regions.

2. 🧹 Data Processing:
• Cleaning and preprocessing the data for analysis.
• Handling missing values and ensuring consistency.

3. 📈 Insights and Visualizations:
• Generating visual reports to highlight trends and correlations.
• Providing actionable insights for policy-making and public health strategies.

4. 🚀 Usage
• Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/raissaalvimt/National-Obesity-By-State.git
cd National-Obesity-By-State;
• Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt;
•  Access the dataset: The raw dataset is located in data/raw/national_obesity_by_state.csv;
• Run the analysis: Use the Jupyter notebook in notebooks/EDA.ipynb for exploratory data analysis.
