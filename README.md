# Overview
This project analyzes the percentage of the population considered obese across different U.S. states, based on data from the 2015 CDC BRFSS Survey. The dataset provides insights into obesity trends and facilitates understanding of factors influencing these patterns at the state level.

# Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the Data.gov catalog, maintained by the Lake County Illinois GIS team.

# Steps in the Project
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of obesity percentages across states. Visualizing patterns and identifying high-risk regions.

Data Processing: Cleaning and preprocessing the data for analysis. Handle missing values and ensure consistency.

Insights and Visualizations: Generating visual reports to highlight trends and correlations. Providing actionable insights for policy-making and public health strategies.
